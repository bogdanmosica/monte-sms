## Implementation Command File

### Purpose
This file serves as a central log and checklist for implementation activities. It ensures that all updates, especially those affecting the `memory` directory, are tracked and completed in accordance with project governance and best practices.

### Instructions
1. Log each implementation step, decision, and required update below.
2. After every feature or change, review and update relevant files in `memory/` (e.g., constitution.md, checklists, specs).
3. Document amendments, migrations, and governance actions here.
4. Reference this file in pull requests and code reviews to verify compliance and completeness.

- [x] **Documentation**: Updated project tasks and implementation status
  - Marked completed infrastructure tasks as ✅
  - Added Montessori-specific model requirements
  - Updated task dependencies and parallel execution examples
  - Added implementation status section to track progress

#### Next Steps Required:
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Extend current schema with Montessori entities (children, observations, portfolios, learning paths)
- [ ] **API Routes**: Implement role-based endpoints for children, observations, admin functions
- [ ] **UI Components**: Create teacher/parent/admin dashboards
- [ ] **Testing**: Implement contract tests for authentication and RBAC
- [ ] **Memory Sync**: Review and update `memory/constitution.md` if needed
