# Feature Specification: Montessori School Management Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-an-app`
**Created**: September 18, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create an app that is a school management platform designed specifically for Montessori kindergartens, bringing together child-centered learning progress, parent communication, and school operations in one seamless system. Unlike generic tools, it supports the Montessori method with activity and observation tracking, personalized portfolios, and a visual kanban learning path that reflects each child’s unique journey. Parents benefit from secure updates and curated advice on how to reinforce learning at home, while teachers gain tools to log observations quickly and focus more on children. Administrators can streamline billing, enrollment, and staff management, reducing paperwork and saving time. The result is a modern, role-based SaaS that empowers schools to deliver better learning experiences, build stronger parent partnerships, and run their operations more efficiently."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A Montessori kindergarten administrator, teacher, and parent interact with the platform to manage learning progress, communicate, and handle school operations. Teachers log observations and activities for each child, parents receive secure updates and advice, and administrators oversee billing, enrollment, and staff management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a teacher is logged in, **When** they record a child’s activity or observation, **Then** the child’s portfolio and kanban learning path are updated.
2. **Given** a parent is logged in, **When** they view their child’s progress, **Then** they see secure updates and curated advice for home reinforcement.
3. **Given** an administrator is logged in, **When** they access billing or enrollment features, **Then** they can manage school operations efficiently.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a parent tries to access another child’s portfolio? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Access control and privacy policy]
- How does the system handle incomplete observation logs or missing activity data?
- What if a teacher or admin forgets to log out on a shared device? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Session timeout and security]
- How are errors in billing or enrollment handled?
