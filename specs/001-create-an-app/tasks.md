Task: "Write integration test: Teacher cannot access admin billing in specs/001-create-an-app/contracts/auth-rbac.test.ts"
Task: "Write integration test: Unauthorized users redirected to login in specs/001-create-an-app/contracts/auth-rbac.test.ts"

# Launch T009-T012 together:

Task: "Implement School model in lib/db/schema.ts"
Task: "Implement Child model in lib/db/schema.ts"
Task: "Implement Session model in lib/db/schema.ts"
```

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T004) before tests (T005-T008)
- Tests (T005-T008) before implementation (T009-T017)
- Models (T009-T012) before services/routes (T013-T017)
- Integration (T018-T022) after core implementation
- Polish (T023-T027) after all implementation

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [ ] All entities have model tasks
- [ ] All tests come before implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
