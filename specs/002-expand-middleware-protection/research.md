# Research for Middleware Protection Expansion

## Session Invalidation on Role Change
- Decision: Invalidate session on role change; require re-authentication.
- Rationale: Prevent privilege escalation and ensure permissions are up-to-date.
- Alternatives: Real-time permission update (rejected for complexity).

## Redirect on Denied Access
- Decision: Redirect to unauthorized page.
- Rationale: Clear user experience, avoids confusion.
- Alternatives: Show error notification (rejected for consistency).

## Logging Access Events
- Decision: Log all authentication and access events in access log entity.
- Rationale: Supports audit, debugging, and compliance.
- Alternatives: Log only errors (rejected for incomplete traceability).

## GDPR/OWASP Compliance
- Decision: Follow GDPR for data retention and OWASP for secure middleware.
- Rationale: Legal and security requirements.
- Alternatives: None (mandatory).
