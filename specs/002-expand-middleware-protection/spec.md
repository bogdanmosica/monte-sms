# Feature Specification: Expand Middleware Protection to All Authenticated Routes for Available Roles

**Feature Branch**: `002-expand-middleware-protection`  
**Created**: September 21, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Expand middleware protection to all authenticated routes for available roles"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated user (Parent, Teacher, Admin), I want to access only the routes permitted for my role, so that unauthorized access is prevented and my data is protected.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is authenticated as Parent, **When** accessing a Parent-only route, **Then** access is granted.
2. **Given** a user is authenticated as Parent, **When** accessing a Teacher or Admin route, **Then** access is denied and the user is redirected or shown an error.
3. **Given** a user is authenticated as Teacher, **When** accessing a Teacher-only route, **Then** access is granted.
4. **Given** a user is authenticated as Teacher, **When** accessing a Parent or Admin route, **Then** access is denied.
5. **Given** a user is authenticated as Admin, **When** accessing any Admin route, **Then** access is granted.
6. **Given** a user is unauthenticated, **When** accessing any protected route, **Then** access is denied and the user is redirected to login.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user's role changes during an active session? Answer: session be invalidated!
- How does the system handle expired or invalid sessions?
- What is the user experience for denied access (redirect, error page, notification)? Answer: redirect!

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enforce middleware protection on all authenticated routes for Parent, Teacher, and Admin roles.
- **FR-002**: System MUST deny access to routes not permitted for the user's role.
- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect or notify users when access is denied. Answer: redirect!
- **FR-004**: System MUST log all authentication and access events.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support dynamic role changes and update permissions accordingly. Answer: next login!
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle session expiration and invalid sessions securely.
- **FR-007**: System MUST comply with GDPR and OWASP guidelines for data and security.

### Key Entities
- **User**: Represents an authenticated individual with a role (Parent, Teacher, Admin). Key attributes: userId, role, session status.
- **Route**: Represents a protected endpoint in the application. Key attributes: routeId, requiredRole(s).
- **Access Log**: Records authentication and access events. Key attributes: timestamp, userId, routeId, eventType.
