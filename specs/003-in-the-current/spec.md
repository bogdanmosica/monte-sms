# Feature Specification: Admin Page Usability & Componentization

**Feature Branch**: `003-in-the-current`  
**Created**: September 22, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "In the current project parts of the front end are built. In order for the admin page to be perfectly usable, we need to update it and use database. Also for consistency and good understanding, the pages needs to be split in multiple components. Each card can be a component."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Admin user
   → Actions: Use admin page, view/manage cards, interact with database-backed data
   → Data: Cards, admin page data, database entities
   → Constraints: Usability, consistency, componentization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific admin actions must be supported?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What data should each card display/manage?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there permissions or RBAC requirements for admin page?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should cards be interactive (edit/delete) or read-only?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. Generate Functional Requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an admin, I want to use the admin page to view and manage key school data, with each card representing a distinct data entity or function, so that I can efficiently oversee operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the admin is logged in, **When** they access the admin page, **Then** they see a set of cards representing different data entities or functions.
2. **Given** the admin views a card, **When** the card displays data from the database, **Then** the data is accurate and up-to-date.
3. **Given** the admin interacts with a card, **When** they perform an allowed action (e.g., edit, delete), **Then** the system updates the database and reflects changes in the UI.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the database is unavailable?
- How does the system handle invalid or missing data for a card?
- What if the admin has insufficient permissions for a card's action?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the admin page as a set of distinct cards, each representing a data entity or function.
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve and display card data from the database in real time.
- **FR-003**: Admins MUST be able to interact with cards to perform allowed actions (e.g., view, edit, delete) 
- **FR-004**: System MUST split the admin page into reusable components, with each card as a separate component.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure UI consistency and accessibility across all admin page components.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle errors gracefully when database or data is unavailable.

### Key Entities
- **Admin Card**: Represents a unit of admin functionality or data (attributes: title, description, data, actions)
- **Admin User**: Represents a user with admin privileges (attributes: name, role, permissions)
- **Database Entity**: Represents underlying data for each card (attributes: entity type, fields, relationships)
