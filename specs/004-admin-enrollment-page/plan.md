# Implementation Plan: Admin Enrollment Page Refactor

**Branch**: `004-admin-enrollment-page` | **Date**: September 22, 2025 | **Spec**: D:\Projects\monte-sms\specs\004-admin-enrollment-page\spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-admin-enrollment-page/spec.md`

## Summary
Refactor the admin enrollment page (`app/(admin)/admin/enrollment/page.tsx`) by splitting it into modular components: Enrollment Stats, Search and Filter, and Enrollment Tabs. Replace all mock data with real data from the database via secure API endpoints. Ensure maintainability, testability, and compliance with constitutional principles.

## Technical Context
- **Language/Version**: TypeScript, Next.js 15
- **Primary Dependencies**: shadcn/ui, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, Auth.js, Vitest
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit, integration, contract)
- **Target Platform**: Web (Next.js frontend + API routes)
- **Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
- **Performance Goals**: Fast load times, responsive UI, efficient DB queries
- **Constraints**: <200ms p95 API latency, GDPR/OWASP compliance, accessibility (WCAG)
- **Scale/Scope**: Up to 10k users, 50 classrooms, 1k concurrent sessions

## Constitution Check
- Modern web stack: Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL ✔️
- Library-first: Components must be modular and reusable ✔️
- API interface: All data via RESTful API routes ✔️
- Test-first: Contract and integration tests before implementation ✔️
- Observability: Log all API actions and errors ✔️
- Versioning: Semantic versioning for breaking changes ✔️
- Accessibility: UI must meet WCAG standards ✔️
- Security: Auth.js for authentication, RBAC enforced ✔️
- Compliance: GDPR and OWASP guidelines followed ✔️

**Gate Status**: Initial Constitution Check: PASS

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
All unknowns resolved. See research.md.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Entities, API contracts, component contracts, and tests to be generated. See data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
Tasks will be generated from contracts, data model, and quickstart. TDD order: Write failing tests for API and components first. Dependency order: Models → Services → API → UI. Parallelize independent tasks.

## Complexity Tracking
No constitution violations detected.
