# Feature Specification: Admin Enrollment Page Refactor

**Feature Branch**: `004-admin-enrollment-page`  
**Created**: September 22, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "admin enrollment page split into components and create APIs for maintainability and real data"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
An admin visits the enrollment page to view, manage, and update student enrollment records. The page is modular, loading real data from backend APIs and allowing maintainable updates.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the admin is authenticated, **When** they access the enrollment page, **Then** the page displays enrollment data loaded from the backend.
2. **Given** the admin is on the enrollment page, **When** they perform an action (e.g., add, edit, or remove an enrollment), **Then** the change is reflected in the UI and persisted via the API.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the API fails to load enrollment data?
- How does the system handle invalid enrollment submissions?
- What if the admin tries to enroll a student who is already enrolled?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST present the admin enrollment page as a set of maintainable, reusable UI components.
- **FR-002**: System MUST load enrollment data from backend APIs.
- **FR-003**: Admins MUST be able to add, edit, and remove enrollment records via the UI.
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist enrollment changes through secure API endpoints.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle and display errors from API failures.
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate enrollment data before submission.
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent duplicate enrollments for the same student. A duplicate is defined as an enrollment record with the same student ID and class/level for an active term.
- **FR-008**: System MUST restrict enrollment management to authorized admin users only.
- **FR-009**: System MUST log all enrollment actions for audit purposes. The log must include: timestamp, admin user ID, action type (add/edit/remove), affected student ID, previous and new values, and API response status.

### Key Entities
- **Enrollment**: Represents a student's enrollment record. Key attributes: student ID, enrollment date, status, class/level, admin who performed the action.
- **Admin User**: Represents a user with permissions to manage enrollments. Key attributes: user ID, role, permissions.
- **Student**: Represents a child enrolled in the school. Key attributes: student ID, name, age, class/level.
