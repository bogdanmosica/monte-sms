# Tasks: Admin Enrollment Page Refactor

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-admin-enrollment-page/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
2. Load optional design documents: data-model.md, research.md, quickstart.md
3. Generate tasks by category: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
4. Apply task rules: [P] for parallel, sequential for same file
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Phase 3.1: Setup

- [x] T007 [P] Write integration test for EnrollmentStats component in `__tests__/enrollment-components.integration.test.tsx`
- [x] T008 [P] Write integration test for SearchAndFilter component in `__tests__/enrollment-components.integration.test.tsx`
- [x] T009 [P] Write integration test for EnrollmentTabs component in `__tests__/enrollment-components.integration.test.tsx`

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation
- [x] T010 Implement EnrollmentStats.tsx component in `app/(admin)/admin/enrollment/components/EnrollmentStats.tsx`
- [x] T011 Implement SearchAndFilter.tsx component in `app/(admin)/admin/enrollment/components/SearchAndFilter.tsx`
- [x] T012 Implement EnrollmentTabs.tsx component in `app/(admin)/admin/enrollment/components/EnrollmentTabs.tsx`
- [x] T013 Implement Applications API endpoint in `app/api/applications/route.ts` and `app/api/applications/[id]/route.ts`
- [x] T014 Implement Enrollments API endpoint in `app/api/enrollments/route.ts` and `app/api/enrollments/[id]/route.ts`
- [x] T015 Implement Students API endpoint in `app/api/students/route.ts`
- [x] T016 Connect components to fetch real data from API endpoints (complete with error handling)
- [x] T017 Implement error handling and logging for all endpoints and components
- [x] T018 Implement RBAC for admin-only access in API endpoints

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [x] T019 Connect Drizzle ORM models to PostgreSQL database in `lib/db/enrollment.ts`
- [x] T020 Integrate authentication (Auth.js) and enforce RBAC in API endpoints
- [x] T021 Ensure audit logging for all enrollment actions
- [x] T022 Validate accessibility (WCAG) for all components (using shadcn/ui accessible components)

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [x] T023 [P] Write unit tests for model validation in `__tests__/enrollment-model.unit.test.ts`
- [x] T024 [P] Write unit tests for API error handling in `__tests__/enrollment-api-error.unit.test.ts`
- [x] T025 [P] Update documentation in `docs/admin-enrollment.md`
- [x] T026 Performance test API endpoints (<200ms p95) in `__tests__/enrollment-api.performance.test.ts`
- [x] T027 Manual validation using quickstart.md

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T002, T003, T004, T005, T006, T007, T008, T009 together:
Task: "Create Drizzle ORM models for Enrollment, Application, Student in lib/db/enrollment.ts"
Task: "Configure linting and formatting (Biome, ESLint) in app/"
Task: "Write contract test for Enrollment API in __tests__/enrollment-api.contract.test.ts"
Task: "Write contract test for Application API in __tests__/application-api.contract.test.ts"
Task: "Write contract test for Student API in __tests__/student-api.contract.test.ts"
Task: "Write integration test for EnrollmentStats component in __tests__/enrollment-stats.integration.test.ts"
Task: "Write integration test for SearchAndFilter component in __tests__/search-filter.integration.test.ts"
Task: "Write integration test for EnrollmentTabs component in __tests__/enrollment-tabs.integration.test.ts"
```

## Dependencies
- Tests (T004-T009) before implementation (T010-T018)
- Models (T002) before endpoints (T013-T015)
- Endpoints before UI data connection (T016)
- Auth/RBAC (T020) before audit logging (T021)
- Implementation before polish (T023-T027)

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All entities have model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
